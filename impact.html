    <h1>Oscar-Claude Monet</h1>
    <h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
    
    <p>
      Monet and his peers helped change the world of painting by shaking off the conventions painting what they saw rather than what the subject was. By dissolving forms in his works, Monet opened the door for further abstraction in art, and he is credited with influencing such later artists as Jackson Pollack, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning.
